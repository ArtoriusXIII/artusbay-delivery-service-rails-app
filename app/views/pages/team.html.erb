                  We are a Dublin-based team, we are affiliated with delivery goods and as a owner I can give you -
                  owners of the store, restaurant managers and customer the confidence that We know what we are doing.
                  <br>
                  At ArtusBayLine we truly understand the issues facing deliveries for clients.
                  After all, we orders the parcels from eCommerce website or Local shop and the worst thing is receiving
                  the approximetly timing from delivery company!
                  <br><br>
                  We believe that the time is money and we ensure our business is dedicated for our clients.
                  So, they could choose the time of the delivery.
                  That’s why I setup ArtusBayLine, to deal with problems we personally experienced as eCommerce clients.
                  No more waiting half day or taking half day off due to not setup delivery time.
                  Our team is dedicated, professional and approachable. We’re always available to answer questions or tackle problems with deliveries.

                 cover 24/7 hours paperwork.
